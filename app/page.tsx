            Understanding the Connection Between Weight Loss Surgery and Hair Loss
          </h3>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Hair loss after weight loss surgery is a common issue, typically occurring about three to six
            months post-surgery. This phenomenon, known as telogen effluvium, is primarily a result of the
            body's response to dietary restrictions and nutritional imbalances. Post-surgery, rapid weight
            loss and changes in how your body absorbs nutrients can lead to deficiencies in critical vitamins
            and minerals necessary for hair growth, such as:

            <li>
              <strong>Protein:</strong> Essential for the production of keratin, the protein that makes up the structure of
              hair.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Iron:</strong> Vital for hair follicle cell growth, as it aids in delivering oxygen to hair roots.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Zinc:</strong> Supports the functioning of oil glands around hair follicles.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Biotin (Vitamin B7):</strong> Plays a crucial role in the production of keratin.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Vitamin A, C, D, and E:</strong> Each contributes to the health of hair and scalp in different ways.
