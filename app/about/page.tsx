          challenges faced by this community and has developed a product that addresses their 
          specific nutritional needs.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Our Story</h2>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The idea for Bari Glow was born from personal experience. Our founder, after undergoing 
          weight loss surgery, experienced significant hair loss and struggled to find a solution 
          that truly understood and addressed the needs of post-bariatric surgery patients. This 
          led to the creation of Bari Glow, a product specifically formulated for this unique situation.
